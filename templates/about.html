    <h2>Want to turn your blog into a business that thrives? Youâ€™re in the right place.</h2>

<h2>Blogging has always required a diverse set of skills.</h2>

    <h3>But in todayâ€™s competitive landscape we have to adapt to the reality that blogging is about more than just writing & publishing blog posts.</h3>

    <h4>One minute youâ€™re a social media manager, the next youâ€™re building an ecommerce store so your readers can buy merch. Then, youâ€™re building a sales funnel that allows you to sell products while you sleep.</h4>

<h5>Then thereâ€™s filming and editing videos, etc.</h5>

<h1>Thatâ€™s a lot. ðŸ¤¯</h1>
